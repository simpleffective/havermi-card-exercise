This is an exercise for basic Frontend-Development skills published by havermi.co.il, 
a coding community that focuses on Junior devs training, and is submitted to a code review.

The Exercise:
Display a "card view" of a random user, given by the API https://randomuser.me/api .

* Bonus - do not use any framework, only vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.
* Recommended Time limit - 2 hours.

MY Exercise:
I have submitted this exercise twice;
1. First time - it worked but was quick & dirty due to the 2 hour time limit, and i had no time left to clean it.
2. Second time - after getting the email Code Review, i took another 1 hour to refactor the code. the code is much much cleaner now.

You are welcome to view the old code for comparison on the first-submittion branch.
